      This is my story of how I became a victim of Emma-Leigh Hoyle.. All pics and videos of chats as evidence are further down. I would like to remain anonymous during this.
<br>
      <br>

      On Tuesday, at around 11pm, I was in a twitch streamers chat and I happened to met a girl that matched my energy and we were somewhat kinda flirting. So I whispered her on twitch and asked for her Instagram and she gave it.
<br>
      <br>



      On Wednesday at around 12am, We fully moved to Instagram and started talking, she asked where I'm from, what's my sexuality is (lesbian). When I took a closer look at her, she looked trans but I didn't want to assume so I asked if she was, and she said "No don't worry about it  I'm not trans, dw". I should've really trusted my gut at this point but I didn't all because she said no she isn't. I asked if she had snapchat because I don't like sending selfies on Instagram as people can easily screenshot pics without my knowledge of them doing so and she said no but then later on she decided to download it I guess and give me her username.
<br>
<br>



      We started talking on snapchat and I showed her what I look like..she said I'm hot and continued to compliment me. After a while of talking things became sexual and teaser pics were sent and at the time I didn't realize it but looking back at it now, one of the worst parts besides me sending her teasers, is that she said, things along the line of, "if you were here you can do (blank) to me and make you (blank) every time you are with me", "can you take off ur panties and put it in ur mouth and send a snap when you are done" I said no because I felt very uncomfortable doing that, she had the audacity to say "your face doesn't have to be in it" and she also said, "firstly we need to get you to jhb and then we can do stuff" and what if I did go to jhb, what would have happened to me?
    <br>
  As things got progressively more sexual, she said she was going to use a toy and she was going to send a snap of her using it. Her exact words were "It's going to be from a weird angle because I have tattoos and It will be easy to figure out who it is and I don't want people to see a public figure ramming their pussy and I went through a lot of trauma in that area" and when she sent it, I had realized she lied about everything, she is trans. I can't explain how I felt because I was so overcome with emotions, I felt so violated and I had my first fully breakdown after a year of going strong. I decided to delete all my pics in chat including my selfies. And when she realized what I did, she all of sudden became very nervous and sent a voice note, further proving my worst fear.
      I made an excuse by saying my WIFI is slow because I really really needed time to myself after that. I've never experienced this before and it still hurts talking about it. I remember messaging my friends straight after it happened hoping atleast one of them would be there for me and one of them was there to comfort me.
      <br>
      <br>

      Later in the day on Wednesday, I messaged my friend and said I was going to ask her why did she lie about being trans? My friend said I should definitely do that and so I messaged her at 16:52 saying hi, I want to ask something. She responded at 17:49 saying Heya, go for it. I responded at 17:49, asking, why did you lie about not being trans? She responded by making an apology but I didn't even feel like an apology, it was just trauma dumping, sh and gaslighting. It felt like a rehearsed apology that she said to others as well. All pics and videos of what happened after this is down below. please consider reading them.
      She acknowledges she's in the wrong as she removed me on snapchat, removed me as a follower on Instagram and made her account private.
      <br>
      <br>



      Please note: I'm not trans-phobic and I'm exposing them for what they have done and not because they are trans. There is a difference. This is also to create awareness so other girls won't possibly fall for it like I did.
